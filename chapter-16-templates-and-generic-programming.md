# Chapter 16 Templates and Generic Programming

​		
**Exercise 16.1:** Define instantiation.

**Exercise 16.2:** Write and test your own versions of the compare functions.

**Exercise 16.3:** Call your compare function on two Sales_data objects to see howyour compiler handles errors during instantiation.

**Exercise 16.4:** Write a template that acts like the library find algorithm. The func-tion will need two template type parameters, one to represent the function’s iteratorparameters and the other for the type of the value. Use your function to find a givenvalue in a vector<int> and in a list<string>.

**Exercise 16.5:** Write a template version of the print function from § 6.2.4 (p. 217) thattakes a reference to an array and can handle arrays of any size and any element type.

**Exercise 16.6:** How do you think the library begin and end functions that take anarray argument work? Define your own versions of these functions.

**Exercise 16.7:** Write a constexpr template that returns the size of a given array.

**Exercise 16.8:** In the “Key Concept” box on page 108, we noted that as a matter ofhabit C++ programmers prefer using != to using <. Explain the rationale for this habit.

**Exercise 16.9:** What is a function template? What is a class template?

**Exercise 16.10:** What happens when a class template is instantiated?

**Exercise 16.11:** The following definition of List is incorrect. How would you fix it?

```c++
template <typename elemType> class ListItem; 
template <typename elemType> class List { 
public:
	List<elemType>();
	List<elemType>(const List<elemType> &); 
  	List<elemType>& operator=(const List<elemType> &); ~List();
	void insert(ListItem *ptr, elemType value);
private:
    ListItem *front, *end;
};
```

**Exercise 16.12:** Write your own version of the Blob and BlobPtr templates. includ-ing the various const members that were not shown in the text.

**Exercise 16.13:** Explain which kind of friendship you chose for the equality and rela-tional operators for BlobPtr.

**Exercise 16.14:** Write a Screen class template that uses nontype parameters to definethe height and width of the Screen.

**Exercise 16.15:** Implement input and output operators for your Screen template.Which, if any, friends are necessary in class Screen to make the input and outputoperators work? Explain why each friend declaration, if any, was needed.

**Exercise 16.16:** Rewrite the StrVec class (§ 13.5, p. 526) as a template named Vec.

**Exercise 16.17:** What, if any, are the differences between a type parameter that is de-clared as a typename and one that is declared as a class? When must typename beused?

**Exercise 16.18:** Explain each of the following function template declarations and iden-tify whether any are illegal. Correct each error that you find.

```c++
(a) template <typename T, U, typename V> void f1(T, U, V); 
(b) template <typename T> T f2(int &T);
(c) inline template <typename T> T foo(T, unsigned int*); 
(d) template <typename T> f4(T, T);
(e) typedef char Ctype;
	template <typename Ctype> Ctype f5(Ctype a);
```

**Exercise 16.19:** Write a function that takes a reference to a container and prints theelements in that container. Use the container’s size_type and size members tocontrol the loop that prints the elements.

**Exercise 16.20:** Rewrite the function from the previous exercise to use iterators re-turned from begin and end to control the loop.

**Exercise 16.21:** Write your own version of DebugDelete.

**Exercise 16.22:** Revise your TextQuery programs from § 12.3 (p. 484) so that the shared_ptr members use a DebugDelete as their deleter (§ 12.1.4, p. 468).

**Exercise 16.23:** Predict when the call operator will be executed in your main query program. If your expectations and what happens differ, be sure you understand why.

**Exercise 16.24:** Add a constructor that takes two iterators to your Blob template.

**Exercise 16.25:** Explain the meaning of these declarations:

```c++
extern template class vector<string>;
template class vector<Sales_data>;
```


**Exercise 16.26:** Assuming NoDefault is a class that does not have a default constructor, can we explicitly instantiate `vector<NoDefault>`? If not, why not?

**Exercise 16.27:** For each labeled statement explain what, if any, instantiations happen. If a template is instantiated, explain why; if not, explain why not.

```c++
template <typename T> class Stack { };
void f1(Stack<char>);     				// (a)
class Exercise {
    Stack<double> &rsd;    				// (b)
    Stack<int>    si; 					// (c)
};
int main() {
	Stack<char> *sc;					// (d)
	f1(*sc);							// (e)
	int iObj = sizeof(Stack< string >);	// (f)
}
```

**Exercise 16.28:** Write your own versions of shared_ptr and unique_ptr.Exercise 16.29: Revise your Blob class to use your version of shared_ptr rather

than the library version.

**Exercise 16.30:** Rerun some of your programs to verify your shared_ptr and re-vised Blob classes. (Note: Implementing the weak_ptr type is beyond the scope ofthis Primer, so you will not be able to use the BlobPtr class with your revised Blob.)

**Exercise 16.31:** Explain how the compiler might inline the call to the deleter if we usedDebugDelete with unique_ptr.

**Exercise 16.32:** What happens during template argument deduction?

**Exercise 16.33:** Name two type conversions allowed on function arguments involved in template argument deduction.

**Exercise 16.34:** Given only the following code, explain whether each of these calls is legal. If so, what is the type of T? If not, why not?		

```c++
template <class T> int compare(const T&, const T&);
(a) compare("hi", "world"); 
(b) compare("bye", "dad");	
```

**Exercise 16.35:** Which, if any, of the following calls are errors? If the call is legal, what is the type of T? If the call is not legal, what is the problem?

```c++
template <typename T> T calc(T, int); 
template <typename T> T fcn(T, T); 
double d; float f; char c;
(a) calc(c, ’c’); (b) calc(d, f);
(c) fcn(c, ’c’); (d) fcn(d, f);
```

**Exercise 16.36:** What happens in the following calls:

```c++
template <typename T> f1(T, T);
template <typename T1, typename T2) f2(T1, T2); 
int i = 0, j = 42, *p1 = &i, *p2 = &j;
const int *cp1 = &i, *cp2 = &j;
(a) f1(p1, p2); 
(b) f2(p1, p2);
(c) f1(cp1, cp2); 
(d) f2(cp1, cp2); 
(e) f1(p1, cp1); 
(f) f2(p1, cp1);
```


**Exercise 16.37:** The library max function has two function parameters and returns thelarger of its arguments. This function has one template type parameter. Could you callmax passing it an int and a double? If so, how? If not, why not?

**Exercise 16.38:** When we call make_shared (§ 12.1.1, p. 451), we have to provide anexplicit template argument. Explain why that argument is needed and how it is used.

**Exercise 16.39:** Use an explicit template argument to make it sensible to pass twostring literals to the original version of compare from § 16.1.1 (p. 652).

**Exercise 16.40:** Is the following function legal? If not, why not? If it is legal, what, if any, are the restrictions on the argument type(s) that can be passed, and what is the return type?

```c++
template <typename It>
auto fcn3(It beg, It end) -> decltype(*beg + 0) {
	// process the range
	return *beg; // return a copy of an element from the range 
}
```

**Exercise 16.41:** Write a version of sum with a return type that is guaranteed to be large enough to hold the result of the addition.

**Exercise 16.42:** Determine the type of T and of val in each of the following calls:

```c++
template <typename T> void g(T&& val);
int i = 0; const int ci = i;
(a) g(i); (b) g(ci); (c) g(i * ci);
```


**Exercise 16.43:** Using the function defined in the previous exercise, what would thetemplate parameter of g be if we called g(i = ci)?

**Exercise 16.44:** Using the same three calls as in the first exercise, determine the typesfor T if g’s function parameter is declared as T (not T&&). What if g’s function parame-ter is const T&?

**Exercise 16.45:** Given the following template, explain what happens if we call g on aliteral value such as 42. What if we call g on a variable of type int?

```c++
template <typename T> void g(T&& val) { vector<T> v; }
```

**Exercise 16.46:** Explain this loop from StrVec::reallocate in § 13.5 (p. 530):

```c++
for (size_t i = 0; i != size(); ++i) 
  alloc.construct(dest++, std::move(*elem++));
```


**Exercise 16.47:** Write your own version of the flip function and test it by calling functions that have lvalue and rvalue reference parameters.

**Exercise 16.48:** Write your own versions of the debug_rep functions.

**Exercise 16.49:** Explain what happens in each of the following calls:

```c++
template <typename T> void f(T); 
template <typename T> void f(const T*); 
template <typename T> void g(T); 
template <typename T> void g(T*);
int i = 42, *p = &i;
const int ci = 0, *p2 = &ci;
g(42); g(p); g(ci); g(p2); f(42); f(p); f(ci); f(p2);
```


**Exercise 16.50:** Define the functions from the previous exercise so that they print an identifying message. Run the code from that exercise. If the calls behave differently from what you expected, make sure you understand why.


**Exercise 16.51:** Determine what sizeof...(Args) and sizeof...(rest) returnfor each call to foo in this section.

**Exercise 16.52:** Write a program to check your answer to the previous question.				

**Exercise 16.53:** Write your own version of the print functions and test them by print-ing one, two, and five arguments, each of which should have different types.

**Exercise 16.54:** What happens if we call print on a type that doesn’t have an <<operator?

**Exercise 16.55:** Explain how the variadic version of print would execute if we de-clared the nonvariadic version of print after the definition of the variadic version.

**Exercise 16.56:** Write and test a variadic version of errorMsg.

**Exercise 16.57:** Compare your variadic version of errorMsg to the error_msg func-tion in § 6.2.6 (p. 220). What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?

**Exercise 16.58:** Write the emplace_back function for your StrVec class and for theVec class that you wrote for the exercises in § 16.1.2 (p. 668).

**Exercise 16.59:** Assuming s is a string, explain svec.emplace_back(s).

**Exercise 16.60:** Explain how make_shared (§ 12.1.1, p. 451) works.

**Exercise 16.61:** Define your own version of make_shared.

**Exercise 16.62:** Define your own version of `hash<Sales_data>` and define an unordered_multiset of Sales_data objects. Put several transactions into the container and print its contents.

**Exercise 16.63:** Define a function template to count the number of occurrences of agiven value in a vector. Test your program by passing it a vector of doubles, avector of ints, and a vector of strings.

**Exercise 16.64:** Write a specialized version of the template from the previous exerciseto handle `vector<const char*>` and a program that uses this specialization.

**Exercise 16.65:** In § 16.3 (p. 698) we defined overloaded two versions of debug_repone had a const char* and the other a char* parameter. Rewrite these functions asspecializations.

**Exercise 16.66:** What are the advantages and disadvantages of overloading thesedebug_rep functions as compared to defining specializations?

**Exercise 16.67:** Would defining these specializations affect function matching fordebug_rep? If so, how? If not, why not?
